This project is based on the different species of fishes, their comparison among each other by 
finding the cumulative counts and cumulative frequency and presenting them through barplots 
and pareto chart. Different functions are used like the count and unique. We get to learn how to 
read a pareto chart and how to use its parameters. Getting to learn how one can add columns to 
the existing dataset using the mutate function. Using pareto chart we will get to know which 
specie has the highest frequency and many other factors
